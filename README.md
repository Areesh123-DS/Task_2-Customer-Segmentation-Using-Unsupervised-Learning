# Task_2-Customer-Segmentation-Using-Unsupervised-Learning

## 🎯 Objective

To identify distinct customer groups using K-Means clustering for better business targeting and marketing.

---

## 🧪 Approach

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used `Annual Income` and `Spending Score` as clustering features
- Applied the **K-Means algorithm**
- Used the **Elbow Method** to determine optimal number of clusters
- Visualized customer segments using scatter plots

---

## 📈 Results

- Optimal number of clusters: **4**
- Segmented customers into meaningful groups based on income and spending habits

---

## 🔍 Findings

- **Cluster 0**: Older customers, moderate income, average spenders
- **Cluster 1**: High-income customers, conservative spenders
- **Cluster 2**: Young males, high income, big spenders
- **Cluster 3**: Young females, good income, frequent spenders
- Each cluster reflects different potential marketing strategies
